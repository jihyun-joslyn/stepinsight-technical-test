                <p class="rules-item">
                    Each round shows a real-world image. Zoom in and examine details — signs, buildings, landscapes,
                    anything can be a clue.
                </p>
                <p class="rules-sub-header">2. Make your guess</p>
                <p class="rules-item">
                    Enter the latitude and longitude where you think the photo was taken. There is no map for guessing.
                </p>
                <p class="rules-sub-header">3. Submit your guess</p>
                <p class="rules-item">
                    After you submit, we calculate the distance and show a map with your guess, the correct location,
                    and the distance between them.
                </p>
                <p class="rules-sub-header">4. Keep going</p>
                <p class="rules-item">
                    Move on to the next round until all 3 rounds are complete.
                </p>
                <p class="rules-header">Scoring</p>
                <p class="rules-item">
                    Get within 50 metres of the correct location and you score points. The closer you are, the more
                    points you earn (up to 15).
                </p>
                <p class="rules-item">
                    Your final score is the total from all three rounds.
                </p>

                <p class="rules-item">
                    At the end, you will see your final score, each round distance, and a summary. You can play again or
                    return home.
